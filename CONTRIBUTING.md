# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in improving the Semantic Frame Pattern (SFP). Contributions are welcome through issues and pull requests. Please describe the problem, provide concise rationale, and keep discussions focused on the methodology rather than specific vocabularies.

## Change process
- Open an issue to propose substantive changes to the specification or examples.
- Submit a pull request that references the relevant issue and includes a clear summary of the change.
- For any specification change, update `CHANGELOG.md` with the new version and a brief description.

## Versioning guidance
- Follow Semantic Versioning when updating the specification: MAJOR for incompatible changes, MINOR for backward-compatible additions, PATCH for clarifications.
- Keep the pattern minimal, implementation-agnostic, and free of concrete tag lists or branded vocabularies.

By contributing, you agree to follow the Code of Conduct.
